# Adaptive Microservices
Gary Leeson. 2020/12/10

"She can'nae take anymore, Captain!!" shouts Scotty as he enters my office. "The system is overloaded because of the number of new customers sales have managed to make this quarter" -  "I know" I reply, "Datadog just alerted me via pager-duty - but there is little we can do at the moment, were scaled out to the limit we are allowed and we will have to ask management for more resources".

Engineers in a micro-service based eco-system have all experienced the above scenario more than once. It's not pleasant when you are the one in the eye of the storm.
